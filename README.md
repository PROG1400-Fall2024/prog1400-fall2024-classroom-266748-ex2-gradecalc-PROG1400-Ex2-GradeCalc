Exercise 2: Grade Calculator

Create a Java program that will convert a letter grade to its numeric counterpart. (You can ignore modifiers like + or -).
Start by creating two arrays:
The first holds the valid letter grades (A, B, C, D, F)
The second holds the corresponding numeric grades (4,3,2,1,0)
Ask the user to enter a letter grade.
Determine and output the corresponding numeric grade, with an appropriate message.
Donâ€™t worry about data validation.
